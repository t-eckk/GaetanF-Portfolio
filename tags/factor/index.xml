      <description>Professional Project &amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;
When interning at Platinium Gestion, I developed an internal tool that would be use to perform portfolio stress testing. This tool was to be simple to use, and simple to understand. It was subject to substitute stress tests done via Bloomberg&amp;rsquo;s PORT function. The tool was developed using Excel and VBA, in line with the softwares in-use within the company.
Key takeaways  Simple models can have similar performances to black box models Using 80% confidence intervals can lead to more interpretable results when stressing portfolios Appropriate factors are especially important when stress testing multi-asset portfolios  Model The tool used a linear multifactor model to stress portfolios.</description>
